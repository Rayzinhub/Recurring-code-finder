# Recurring-code-finder
The plan is to develop a vending machine, where we insert coins with preprogrammed code referring to a particular product in the rack after the payment by the user at the cash counter. Works the same way as the metro ticket, but after inserting into the machine thr ticket has to match the correct product code and drop down the shelf.
